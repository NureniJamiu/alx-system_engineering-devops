# Welcome to 0x01-shell_permissions
## Description
#### The unix-like operating systems, such as Linux differ from other computing systems in that they are not only multitasking but also multi-user. In order to make this practical, a method had to be devised to protect the users from each other. **Hence, this section focuses on how to set file permissions based on users' priviledges.** After all, we wouldn't want the actions of one user to crash the computer, nor would we allow one user to interfare with the files belonging to another user.

#### 0-iam_betty
   This script switches the current user to the user `betty`.
